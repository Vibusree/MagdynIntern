This is not a simple login page UI using html and css that is non functional. I have made this login page working with the sql databases at the backend. 
To achieve this i have used the PHP concepts. And used Xampp php server to handle the Mqsql server . 
The  functionality of the login page is 
     -> New user registration
     -> The registration details stored at backend
     -> Already existing user login
     -> Login check at the backend
     -> Navigating to a dashboard after login
     -> Displaying the details of registered users if existed
     -> Completing the profile setup if not existed
